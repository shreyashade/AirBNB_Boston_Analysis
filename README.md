## 1. Introduction

The short-term rental market, dominated by platforms like AirBNB, has transformed the hospitality industry. Understanding the factors that influence pricing is crucial for hosts, travelers, and market analysts. This analysis aims to build a predictive model for AirBNB listing prices in Boston, leveraging a comprehensive dataset of property characteristics, host attributes, and guest reviews.

Our goal is to develop a model with high predictive accuracy, as measured by R-squared and RMSE metrics. Through advanced feature engineering and ensemble modeling techniques, we'll create a robust price prediction system that captures the complex relationships between various factors and listing prices.


## 2. Data Loading and Exploration

We begin by loading the Boston AirBNB dataset and exploring its structure and content. This dataset contains detailed information about listings, including property characteristics, host information, location data, and guest reviews.

**Observations:**

- The dataset contains a variety of data types, including numerical, categorical, and text data.
- There are missing values in several columns, which will need to be addressed during preprocessing.
- The price distribution is skewed, with a long tail of higher-priced listings.
- Property types, room types, and neighborhoods show significant variations in frequency and price ranges.
- There are correlations between numeric features and price, suggesting potential predictors.


## 3. Data Preprocessing

Before building our models, we need to preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and prepare features for modeling.

**Steps:**

- Handle missing values in the target variable by removing rows with NaN values.
- Handle outliers in the target variable using winsorization to cap extreme values.


## 4. Advanced Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is crucial for improving model performance. We create a variety of sophisticated features that capture different aspects of the listings.

**Location-based Features:**

- Distance to Boston city center.
- Neighborhood price statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, count).
- Price relative to neighborhood.
- Neighborhood density.

**Property-based Features:**

- Price per accommodates/bedrooms/beds/bathrooms.
- Density metrics (e.g., bedrooms per accommodates).
- Space efficiency metrics.
- Property type grouping.
- Room type features (e.g., is_entire_home).

**Host-based Features:**

- Host experience (in days and years).
- Host verification features (e.g., has_phone_verification).
- Host response metrics (e.g., response_time_numeric).
- Host quality score (combination of response rate, acceptance rate, and superhost status).
- Host identity verification.
- Host listing experience.

**Review-based Features:**

- Review quality and quantity metrics (e.g., reviews_per_month_filled).
- Review recency and frequency (e.g., days_since_last_review).
- Review scores composite.
- Review to rating ratio.
- Review frequency (e.g., reviews_per_year).
- Review sentiment approximation.

**Amenities Features:**

- Amenities count and categories (e.g., essential, luxury, safety).
- Amenity quality score.

**Text-based Features:**

- Description length and quality (e.g., name_length, summary_word_count).
- Text richness score.
- Keyword counts (e.g., luxury_keyword_count).

**Interaction Features:**

- Interactions between important variables (e.g., accommodates_bedrooms_interaction).
- Polynomial features for key numeric features.


## 5. Model Building and Evaluation

Now that we have created a rich set of features, we build and evaluate various models to predict listing prices.

### 5.1 Baseline Models

We train several baseline models, including:

- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- ElasticNet
- Ridge
- Lasso
- SVR
- Huber

**Observations:**

- Tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM) generally perform well, achieving high R-squared values and relatively low RMSE.
- Linear models (ElasticNet, Ridge, Lasso) also show decent performance, but may be more sensitive to outliers.
- Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Huber Regression provide alternative approaches but may require more tuning.

### 5.2 Ensemble Methods

Ensemble methods can often outperform individual models by combining their strengths. We implement several ensemble approaches:

#### 5.2.1 Voting Ensemble

Combines predictions from multiple base models using a voting scheme.

#### 5.2.2 Stacking Ensemble

Trains a meta-model on the predictions of base models.

#### 5.2.3 Blending Ensemble

Similar to stacking, but uses a hold-out validation set to train the meta-model.

#### 5.2.4 Final Model Selection

Compares the performance of all models and selects the best one based on R-squared and RMSE.

**Observations:**

- Ensemble methods generally improve performance compared to individual baseline models.
- Stacking and blending ensembles often achieve the highest R-squared values and lowest RMSE.
- The final model selection depends on the specific dataset and desired performance metrics.


## 6. Feature Importance Analysis

We analyze which features are most important for predicting listing prices using the best model.

**Observations:**

- The most important features often include location-based features, property characteristics, and review scores.
- Host-based features and amenities can also contribute significantly to predictions.
- Feature importance analysis provides insights into the key drivers of AirBNB listing prices.


## 7. Error Analysis

We analyze the errors of our best model to understand its strengths and weaknesses.

**Observations:**

- The error distribution is generally centered around zero, indicating unbiased predictions.
- There may be some larger errors for certain types of listings, suggesting areas for improvement.
- Error analysis helps identify potential biases and areas where the model could be refined.


## 8. Review Analysis

We analyze the reviews to gain insights into guest experiences and property quality.

**Observations:**

- Sentiment analysis reveals the overall sentiment expressed in reviews.
- Word clouds highlight frequently used words and topics.
- Review analysis provides valuable qualitative information that can complement the quantitative model.


## 9. Conclusions and Recommendations

This analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of advanced feature engineering and ensemble modeling techniques for predicting AirBNB listing prices in Boston.

**Insights:**

- Location, property characteristics, and reviews are key factors influencing listing prices.
- Host attributes and amenities can also play a significant role.
- Ensemble methods can improve predictive accuracy compared to individual models.

**Recommendations:**

- Hosts can use the model to optimize their pricing strategies.
- Travelers can use the model to find listings that offer good value for money.
- Market analysts can use the model to understand pricing trends and dynamics.
- Further research could explore additional features, model refinement, and application to other markets.
